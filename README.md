## Summary of Findings
In the exploration,I found that there is a relationship between sales and a video genre
that there is a certain category of games that is the best-selling and most productive,
and also there is a positive relationship between years and sales. 
The more years, the greater the sales.
In order to play these games, there must be specialized platforms in this, and we find that there are many platforms, but there are some popular and most used platforms, 
and this is what I found in investigate.
I found that there is a relationship between the platform and the gener that there are platforms that publish games of a certain type, as well as a relationship between the publisher and the platform, 
and that there are some publishers who have platforms for them, such as Sony and nintendo.
